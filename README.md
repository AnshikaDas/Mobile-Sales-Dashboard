The Mobile Sales Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project developed to analyze and visualize mobile sales performance across multiple dimensions such as product category, brand, region, and time period. The main objective of this project is to provide business stakeholders with actionable insights into sales trends, revenue growth, and profitability. The dataset was cleaned and structured for analysis, and data modeling was performed to build relationships between key tables. Various DAX measures were created to calculate KPIs like total sales, profit margin, revenue by region, and top-performing products. The dashboard includes dynamic filters, slicers, and visual charts that help users explore data in real time. This project demonstrates strong skills in Power BI dashboard design, data modeling, performance tracking, and business intelligence reporting, enabling data-driven decision-making for sales optimization and strategic planning.
